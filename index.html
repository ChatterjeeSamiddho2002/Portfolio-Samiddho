  <section class="content"><h2>About Me</h2></section>
  <span> Hey there! My name is Samiddho Chatterjee, a current student of Masters of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Birla Instiute of Technology, MESRA campus.
I have done my graduation in Electronics and Communication engineering from Vellore Instiute of Technology, Chennai campus. I interned at KPIT, Pune office from January 2025 till July 2025 as an Embedded Systems and C Engineer 
I have interest in Analog circuits, Microwave and RF Circuit Communicatrion and VLSI Circuitry and hence my specialization in my Masters is in that domain. Other than my interests in core domain, my other interest lies in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and Deep Learning
My hobbies include watching a lot of sports and playing, and have recently started a fan-page write account on one of my favourite clubs. </span>
  <section class="content"><h2>Experience</h2></section>
  <span> Embedded Systems and C Engineer at KPIT, Pune office
    Worked on STM32 boards using GPIO, Timers, ADC and DAC, and HAL Drivers
    Worked on the automotive CAN protocol 
    Worked on AUTOSAR methodology with its architectures and vehicular structures (chassis)
  </span>
  <section class="content"><h2>Projects</h2></section>
  <span> Deep Learning Approach for Radar Signal Processing for Earthquake Triggered Landslide Detection
    Worked on DeepLabV3+ model and created the model from scratch and found out its Dice Loss, Accuracy and other parameters
    Worked on an already existing UNET Model and compared it with the DeepLabV3+ model.
  </span>
  <span> Li-Fi model for audio transfer
    A small project during the scheduled course topic for transmission of data signal (here audio signals) through light as a medium
    Wi-Fi works at a frequency of around 2.4GHz, however we are using more Bandwidth when using visible light and thus more data rate (Shannon's Law) 
  </span>
